The Intel Edison Connectivity Framework (IECF) allows one to discover and communicate with others.
Additionally, IECF allows an Edison conveniently publish its data to the cloud and enables others to
subscribe to that data from the cloud. The IECF is a library that comes on the Edison board in
two flavors: C and NodeJS.

This documentation focuses on the C version of the library.
