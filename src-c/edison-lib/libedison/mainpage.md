The Intel Edison Connectivity Framework (IECF) allows one Edison to discover and communicate with other Edisons.
Additionally, IECF allows an Edison to conveniently publish its data to the cloud and enables other Edisons to
subscribe to that data from the cloud. The IECF is a library that comes pre-installed on the Edison board in
two flavors: C and NodeJS.

This documentation focuses on the C version of the library.
