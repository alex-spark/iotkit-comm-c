[Start Here](@ref start-here.md) to begin developing applications and plugins that use iotkit-comm connectivity library. Otherwise, continue
reading to learn more.

iotkit-comm allows network-connected devices to conveniently discover and communicate with each other and the cloud. More specifically,
iotkit-comm library enables developers to write distributed applications composed of clients and servers.
This library was designed primarily for IntelÂ® Edison platform, but works well on other platforms too. iotkit-comm
comes in two flavors: C and node.js. This documentation focuses on the C version of the library.
